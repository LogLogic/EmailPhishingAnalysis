# Phishing Email Analysis â€“ German PayPal Spoof

Investigated a suspicious email written in German that impersonated PayPal and was delivered to a leaked personal email address. The email used a spoofed sender, an obfuscated malicious link, and social engineering to trick the recipient into clicking.

This project replicates a real-world SOC Level 1 phishing triage scenario and demonstrates email header analysis, link decoding, OSINT techniques, and threat detection workflow.
